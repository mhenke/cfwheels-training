It is relatively easy to develop with and can be used for awesome sites like <a href="http://AmtrakGuestRewards.com">AmtrakGuestRewards.com</a>, or cool ones like <a href="http://Meritbuilder.com">Meritbuilder.com</a> and <a href="http://Singsnap.com">Singsnap.com</a>.</p><p>You'll spend the two days working through a single concept by creating a simple blog system and learning the basics of ColdFusion On Wheels including:</p><ul><li>Models, Views, and Controllers</li><li>Data Structures &amp; Relationships</li><li>Routing</li><li>Migrations</li><li>Views with forms, partials, and helpers</li><li>RESTful design</li><li>Using Wheels plugins</li></ul><h2 id="WheelsHistory">Wheels History</h2><p>Rob Cameron founded the ColdFusion on Wheels project in 2005. He still blogs about ColdFusion, Rails, and open source software on his personal site, <a href="http://www.ridingtheclutch.com/">Riding the Clutch</a>. Following Rob, Per Djurner was the principal developer of ColdFusion on Wheels and helped lead the project to finishing the 1.0 and 1.1 releases. Now Anthony Petruzzi is the principal developer of the Wheels core team. He has a blog called <a href="http://rip747.wordpress.com/">Ripâ€™s Domain</a>.</p><p>Wheels approach is very different from other ColdFusion frameworks. Wheels was inspired by Ruby on Rails. Rails was extracted from the real world unlike other Java and Microsoft introduced frameworks. Rails and Wheels try to solve only the necessary problems and defer developing features until they are necessary. The simplicity approach is a big hit and has powered the growth of the Rails and Wheels communities ever since.</p><h2 id="License">License</h2><p>These works were created by Jeff Casimir (jeff@jumpstartlab.com) and <a href="http://jumpstartlab.com">Jumpstart Lab</a>.
