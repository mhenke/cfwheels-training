For instance, there would be a list of links with the names of the months and when you click on the month it shows you all the articles published in that month.</li><li>Track the number of times an article has been viewed. Add a <code>view_count</code> column to the article, then in the <code>show</code> method of <code>Articles.cfc</code> just increment that counter. Or, better yet, add a method in the <code>article.cfc</code> model that increments the counter and call that method from the controller.</li><li>Once you are tracking views, create a list of the three most popular articles</li><li>Create a simple <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed for articles using Provides and <span class="caps">XML</span> view templates</li></ul></body></html>
