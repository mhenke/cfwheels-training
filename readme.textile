"ColdFusion On Wheels":http://cfwheels.org is a powerful web application framework that has become popular in the past few years. It is relatively easy to develop with and can be used for awesome sites like "AmtrakGuestRewards.com":http://AmtrakGuestRewards.com, or ones like "Meritbuilder.com":http://Meritbuilder.com and "Singsnap.com":http://Singsnap.com.

You'll spend the two days working through a single concept by creating a simple blog system and learning the basics of ColdFusion On Wheels including:

* Models, Views, and Controllers
* Data Structures & Relationships
* Routing
* Migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* RESTful design
* Using Wheels plugins
