h2. Abstract

"ColdFusion On Wheels":http://cfwheels.org is a powerful web application framework that has become popular in the past few years. It is relatively easy to develop with and can be used for awesome sites like "AmtrakGuestRewards.com":http://AmtrakGuestRewards.com, or other cool ones like "Meritbuilder.com":http://Meritbuilder.com and "Singsnap.com":http://Singsnap.com.

You'll spend the two days working through a single concept by creating a simple blog system and learning the basics of ColdFusion On Wheels including:

* Models, Views, and Controllers
* Data Structures & Relationships
* Routing
* Migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* RESTful design
* Using Wheels plugins

h2. CFWheels History

Rob Cameron founded the ColdFusion on Wheels project in 2005. He still blogs about Ruby, Rails, and open source software on his personal site, Riding the Clutch. Per Djurner was the principal developer of ColdFusion on Wheels and helped lead the project to finishing the 1.0 and 1.1 releases. Now Anthony Petruzzi is the principal developer of the Wheels core team. He has a blog called Ripâ€™s Domain.

Wheels approach is very different from other ColdFusion frameworks. Wheels was inspired by Ruby on Rails. Rails was extracted from the real world unlike other Java and Microsoft introduced frameworks. Wheels tried to solve only the necessary problems and defer developing features until they are necessary. The simplicity approach was a big hit and has powered the growth of the Wheels community ever since.
