h1. About Wheels

Rob Cameron founded the ColdFusion on Wheels project in 2005. He still blogs about Ruby, Rails, and open source software on his personal site, Riding the Clutch. Per was the principal developer of ColdFusion on Wheels and helped lead the project to finishing the 1.0 and 1.1 releases. Now Anthony Petruzzi is the principal developer of the Wheels core team. He has a blog called Rip's Domain.

Wheels approach is very different from other ColdFusion frameworks. Wheels was inspired by Ruby on Rails. Rails was extracted from the real world unlike other Java and Microsoft introduced frameworks. Wheels tried to solve only the necessary problems and defer developing features until they are necessary. The simplicity approach was a big hit and has powered the growth of the Wheels community ever since.
