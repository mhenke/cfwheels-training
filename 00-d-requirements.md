# Requirements to Participate

## Requirements to Participate

There are very few requirements to participate in this course:

- Age **\\** If you’re over 18, you’re good**\\** If you’re under 18,  
 I’d feel most comfortable if you are partnered with an adult  
 attendee. If that’s not possible, it’s probably still ok but I’d  
 like to talk to you and a parent/guardian first.

- Technology \\**\\** One laptop per attendee. Windows is ideal, but  
 Mac OS X and Linux are OK too.

- Language \\**\\** I don’t have the capability right now for serving  
 persons who don’t read/speak English. Sorry!

- Accessibility \\**\\** As much as possible all projected materials  
 (documents, slides, code) are available in print and on your screen  
 for easy viewing. We want to be fully inclusive, so if there is  
 something you need to work at your best, let us know and well do  
 our best to make it happen.
