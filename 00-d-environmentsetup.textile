h2. Requirements to Participate

There are very few requirements to participate in a JumpstartLab course:

* Age
** If you're over 18, you're good


* If you're under 18, I'd feel most comfortable if you are partnered with an adult attendee. If thats not possible, it's probably still ok but I'd like to talk to you and a parent/guardian first.

* Technology
** One laptop per attendee. Windows is ideal, but Mac OS X and Linux are OK too.


* Language
** I don't have the capability right now for serving persons who don't read/speak English. Sorry!


* Accessibility
** Our working space is served by an elevator and wheelchair accessible. As much as possible all projected materials (documents, slides, code) are available in print and on your screen for easy viewing. We want to be fully inclusive, so if there is something you need to work at your best, let us know and well do our best to make it happen.
